Alright fools listen up. I spent a lot of fucking time setting up this shit so pay attention.
Below you're gonna find the link to the google doc folder with all the data sets and shit.
The only thing on this github will be the updated python script as we go. I will be in charge of pushing any final commits to the master branch.
Hit me up if you fools need help with making push requests to the master branch.
